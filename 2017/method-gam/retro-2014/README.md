## Retro fitting to the 2014 election

Probabilistic prediction model for the New Zealand general election

This folder has code for the method using generalized additive models to predict the mean and covariance matrix of election day party vote on election day (on logit scale).

This takes the approach used for the 2017 election to try to predict the 2014 election from six months before the election.
