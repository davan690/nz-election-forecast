# Estimates the "house effects" for each combination of polling firm and party.
# Note there is built into this (in estimate-house-effects.stan) a prior distribution
# for the effect of N(0, 0.15), indicating we expect if true party intended vote is
# 50%, 90% of house effects are between -6% and +6%, which seems reasonably uninformative while
# still having some centring/shrinkage effect.
# Good discussion of priors at https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Prior-Choice-Recommendations
# Note from "https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstan/vignettes/rstan.html":
#  "(Just be careful: the second argument to Stanâ€™s normal  distribution is the standard deviation, 
# not the variance as is usual in statistical notation.)".  It follows R norm in this.
