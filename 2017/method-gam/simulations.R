# where a gam fits the lines (see estimate-election-variance.R) and treats that as the 
# individual variance of the actual election observation.  This is added to the sum of the
# standard errors for the prediction of the latent party vote variable to create an expected
# standard deviation of the distribution for each party mean.  The correlation matrix
# from the GAM predicting this year's eleciton is used as a basis, scaled up by this standard
# deviation, to create a new covariance matrix
